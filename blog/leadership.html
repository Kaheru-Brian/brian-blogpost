                      <p>
                        In the leadership class we managed to reflect on our lives and how we ought to live our live while living the 7 habits. This class was based on the book written by Stephen R.covey and it included all the habits  a person should lead including :
                        <ol>
                          <li>Habit 1 ; Being proactive</li>
                          <li>Habit 2 ; Beigin with the end in mind</li>
                          <li>Habit 3 ; Put first things first</li>
                          <li>Habit 4 ; Think-win-win</li>
                          <li>Habit 5 ; Seek first to understand then to be understood</li>
                          <li>Habit 6 ;; Synegize</li>
                          <li>Habit 7 ; Sharpen the saw (a habit of personal development )</li>
                        </ol>
                  </p>
 
                      <p>We watched a series of videos that helped us to capture exactly the meaning of the book and life at large.</p>

                      <p>
                        Julia and Micheal  made the classes interesting and interactive as we were put in breakout rooms to further participate and interact with one another. Being that we are an online class, that helped us to get ot network and get to know each other on a personal level. 
                        This class helps improves ones communication skills and also bringout the extrovertism in you.
