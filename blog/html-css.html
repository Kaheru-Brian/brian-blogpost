        <h1>HTML and CSS Class By Samson Kapeyi!!!  </h1>
    </div>

                <div class="col-5" >
                        <div class="row"> <h2>HTML/CSS</h2> </div>

                        <p>In this class we were introduced to coding (writing tags and lines) and also had a brief intro to the internet and how it works</p>

                        <p>This class was facilitated by Samson kapeyi, and made it even more interesting by being interactive and fun all the time. Those with macs had it all going well and if you support man u you were in for it “kidding “it was just to keep the class lively and help us grasp a lot.</p>

                        <p>
                            In aa span of 2 weeks, I can say I designed my first site and got to learn more about GIT and GITHUB something I didn’t even know about.
                            Generally, this class gave us a brief intro to web designing from a backend point of view and when one looks at a code they can easily know.
