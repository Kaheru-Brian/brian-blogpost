                <p>I‚Äôm Brian Kaheru aka <i style="color: blue;"> to be known as Coding B</i>. I‚Äôm currently pursuing a certificate of software development @ Refactory Academy. For a while, I have self-learned a lot on my journey of programming and do not want anyone to make the same mistakes I did. Hence, this blog is dedicated to everyone who dreams of becoming a good programmer.</p>

                <p><b> I request that you read the entire blog in depth so that you can get the most out of it.</b></p>
                <p>
                    You may or may not have finished uni, but can still have a career in the IT sector. This guide is for my fellow newbies to the world of coding/programing out there, <q>in the chaos of <b>‚ÄúHow do I start programming"?</b></q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before joining Refactory Academy, the only knowledge about programming I had was some simple HTML and CSS, this is because I got to teach myself on the internet using w3schools website but I could not really grasp it well as I needed some external push and almost gave up. All I wanted was to become a software developer and build apps, software, and websites, but I came to realize that HTML was not even a programming language ü•¥ and I needed to learn more. My prayer and cry got answered, When I learnt about Refactory and what it does, the programmer in me became equally excited <i>(like dude what are you waiting for?!)</i>. I jumped on the internet and read about it to learn more, and how to join. I got interested because the program scope was really so nice and it‚Äôs all I ever wanted (CERT in Software development using python and many more!!). And the fact that it was fully online <q> oh boy !!!‚Äù </q>I got even more happier and excited to join this, because they teach exactly what is needed in the world/field of IT and programming in in a short time and remotely. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I heard that students from Refactory were working on projects with IT companies around the world or with startups, I got goosebumps. I felt, ‚ÄúWhen would I be coding those cool applications? I don‚Äôt even know basic logic building yet!‚Äù. The programmer in me said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry everyone starts just like thisü•∫, provided you start!‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refactory has a variety of programming languages you get to choose which one you want, including; python, JavaScript among others. After banging my head, a lot for choosing my first language, I selected Python (great choice, right?!). You can opt for JjavaScript or any other, whatever suits you. Many beginner tutorials out there give suggestions about Python being the easiest language (because you don‚Äôt have semicolons there; P).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Story short, I joined, and we started of with interestingly HTML and CSS, things I had some ideas of, then there came leadership and personal development, and critical thinking all great classes (honestly, though other two classes we a surprise to me, it was like ordering for a package and getting more than what you expected‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Great!! Right??). <strong>Two weeks down the road,  can build my first web page blog (not as perfect!!1 but I shall get there with more practice.).</strong> I can also be able to express myself and m learning more about public speaking through the leadership class.
